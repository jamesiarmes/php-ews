# Examples on Working With the Calendar

This section is meant to show you practical examples on how to work with the Calendar and events through EWS. For now,
the main examples are as follows:

 * [Working with different Calendars](workingWithDifferentCalendars.php)
 * [Getting a list of Events](getCalendarItems.php)
 * [Creating Events](createItem.php)
 * [Updating Events](updateEvent.php)
 * [Getting all changes to events](getListOfChanges.php)
 * [Deleting Events](deleteItem.php)

While this isn't to serve as a tutorial, or as a complete list of things you can do through EWS, this should serve
as a good launching point for easy to build features that involve the Calendar. If you have any trouble with these,
or would like to see more specific examples, feel free to file an issue on Github, and I'll try to respond
