# PHP Exchange Web Services
The PHP Exchange Web Services library (php-ews) is intended to make communication with Microsoft Exchange servers using Exchange Web Services easier. It handles the NTLM authentication required to use the SOAP services and provides an object-oriented interface to the complex types required to form a request.

# Dependencies
* PHP 5.2+
* cURL with NTLM support (7.23.0+ recommended)
* Exchange 2007 or 2010*

**Note: Not all operations or request elements are supported on Exchange 2007.*


## Installation
Clone the project from git into the desired location.

```
git clone git@github.com:jamesiarmes/php-ews.git php-ews
```

## Autoloading
The library is not currently PSR-0 compliant so you will need to include files in one of two ways:

1\. Include each file as you need it. Each data type is contained within its own file and will need to be included individualy. For example:

```php
require_once 'php-ews/EWSType/CalendarItemType.php';
require_once 'php-ews/EWSType/BodyType.php';
```

2\. Use a custom autoload function. For example:

```php
/**
 * Function to autoload the requested class name.
 * 
 * @param string $class_name Name of the class to be loaded.
 * @return boolean Whether the class was loaded or not.
 */
function __autoload($class_name)
{
    // Start from the base path and determine the location from the class name,
    $base_path = 'path/to/php-ews';
    $include_file = $base_path . '/' . str_replace('_', '/', $class_name) . '.php';

    return (file_exists($include_file) ? require_once $include_file : false);
}
```

## Usage
The library can be used to make several different request types. In order to make a request, you need to instantiate a new `ExchangeWebServices` object:

```php
$ews = new ExchangeWebServices($server, $username, $password, $version);
```

The `ExchangeWebServices` class takes four parameters for its constructor:

* `$server`: The url to the exchange server you wish to connect to, without the protocol. Example: mail.example.com. If you have trouble determing the correct url, you could try using the [`EWSAutodiscover`](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/wiki/Autodiscovery) class.
* `$username`: The user to connect to the server with. This is usually the local portion of the users email address. Example: "user" if the email address is "user@example.com".
* `$password`: The user's plain-text password.
* `$version` (optional): The version of the Exchange sever to connect to. Valid values can be found at `ExchangeWebServices::VERSION_*`. Defaults to Exchange 2007.

Once you have your `ExchangeWebServices` object, you need to build your request object. The type of object depends on the operation you are calling. If you are using an IDE with code completion it should be able to help you determine the correct classes to use using the provided docblocks.

The request objects are build similar to the XML body of the request. See the resources section below for more information on building the requests.
